<p>This chap-book is not a story. It is a collection of charms
and dreams supposed to have been communicated by a personage
bearing the name of Mother Bunch, a name unhistorical and,
so far as I have been able to ascertain, unknown to any other
department of literature.</p>

<p>The edition here printed is made up of two distinct parts.
The first part is the oldest, and at one time the only portion
extant. This is reprinted from the copy in the Pepsyian
Library at Cambridge, dated 1685. The second part is printed
from the copy in the British Museum library, and dated by
the authorities there 1780, this being the earliest version I have
been able to find.</p>

<p>From the wording of its title, &#8220;Mother Bunch&rsquo;s Closet
<em>Newly</em> Broke Open,&#8221; there is evidence of the first part being
a continuation of a chap-book already issued upon the same
subject. For this we must refer to a jest-book first published
in 1604, the title of which runs as follows: <cite>Pasquil&rsquo;s Jests,
mixed with Mother Bunche&rsquo;s Merriments</cite>...... This book
is a well-known collection of jests of a rather broad nature, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg ii]</span>

its style of composition lent itself to a continuation such as
we have in the chap-book now under consideration. There
is no other connection between the two publications than the
title.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The later editions of this chap-book differ considerably from
that of 1685 in the Pepsyian Collection. Almost every page
varies, and that too in no inconsiderable manner. It is not
perhaps necessary to point out all the variations because they
are not of great literary or historical interest, but it may be well
to indicate the chief differences. The 1685 edition, as here
printed, contains two parts. These in later editions are amalgamated,
and the title on page 10, &#8220;The second part of
Mother Bunch, who lived at Bonny Ventor in the West,&#8221;
does not therefore appear. As a specimen of the later editions,
the following is the opening passages of the 1780 edition, and
other pages are similarly altered:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Mother Bunch&rsquo;s Cabinet Broke Open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reading over many ancient histories, it was my chance to
meet with a story of an old woman who lived in the west
country, who took delight in studying her fortune; when she
found herself full twenty years old, she thought her luck worse
than some who were married at fifteen or sixteen, which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg iii]</span>

much troubled her mind; but to prevent all doubts she resolved
to try a story she had often heard her mother talk of, and,
finding it true, she resolved to teach other wonders.</p>

<p>&#8220;On a time this old woman, having newly buried her husband,
was taking a walk in the fields for the benefit of the air,
sometimes thinking of the loss of her husbands, for she had
had three, yet had a great desire for the fourth. So it happened
as she was walking alone she espied a young maid by a
meadow side. Good morrow, maid, said the old woman; how
do you do? are not you well? Yes, mother, I am very well,
but somewhat troubled in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The paragraph on page 20 is entirely left out in the later
editions, and the following addition is made:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Now Mother Bunch&rsquo;s store exhaust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">She sits her down to spin;</div>
    <div class="verse">Then studies how she soon may make</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Her Second Part begin.</div>
<br />
    <div class="verse">Which now is finished and sold</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Where you have had the First,</div>
    <div class="verse">&rsquo;Twill make you wise, also to laugh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Untill your sides do burst.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>These are all the points of difference which it will be necessary
to note between the 1685 edition, now reprinted, and
those that appeared later in conjunction with the new second
part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span></p>

<p>The woodcuts in these chap-books are of the rudest description,
and they did not appear worth reproducing. Mr. Ashton,
in his <cite>Chap-books of the Eighteenth Century</cite>, pp. 84&ndash;87, has
given three woodcuts from the second part of the 1780 edition,
and the following lines, which, together with the funeral picture,
make the finish of the book. These lines are not printed on
our last page:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Thus all her Art at length could not her save,</div>
    <div class="verse">From death&rsquo;s dire stroke, and mould&rsquo;ring in the grave.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>We will now discuss the special importance of Mother
Bunch&rsquo;s collection of dreams and prognostications. It is well
known that these subjects form a not unimportant branch of
folk-lore, and it is therefore interesting to find that through the
medium of this seventeenth-century chap-book we have preserved
to us some scraps of folk-lore which are of value. They
for the most part group themselves round certain days in the
calendar, and it will therefore perhaps be best to adopt this
arrangement for our consideration of them. Thus we have
St. Agnes&rsquo; Day (21 Jan.), Valentine&rsquo;s Day (14 Feb.),
20th April, Midsummer Eve (24 June), St. Luke&rsquo;s Day
(Oct. 18), St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day (Dec. 21). Almost all the
customs recorded by Mother Bunch on these days are incorporated
by Sir Henry Ellis in his edition of Brand&rsquo;s <cite>Popular
Antiquities</cite>; but their original value is ascertained by the
independent practice of the self-same customs in many parts
of England, as noted by authorities who did not know Mother

<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span>

Bunch. Take, for instance, St. Agnes&rsquo; Day. Ben Jonson,
Aubrey in his <cite>Miscellanies</cite>, Burton in his <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>,
Barnaby Googe, all refer to the self-same customs recorded in
this chap-book. Of course if this rule held good throughout,
and in matters of detail, it might be said that the chap-book
was copied from these earlier authorities. But this can be
shown not to be so by one curious piece of evidence. The
Scottish St. Agnes rhyme differs from that of Mother Bunch.
It is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Agnes sweet, and Agnes fair,</div>
    <div class="verse">Hither, hither, now repair,</div>
    <div class="verse">Bonny Agnes let me see</div>
    <div class="verse">The lad who is to marry me.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>(See <cite>Times Telescope</cite>, 1823, p. 15.) Again, the 20th April is
not a festival day, but in Worcestershire there is a belief in the
county that the cuckoo is never heard till Tenbury Fair day,
which is the 20th April (Dyer&rsquo;s <cite>Popular Customs</cite>, p. 192); a
fact which, when compared to the narrative on page 6, goes far
to prove that this Worcestershire belief was known to the
author of Mother Bunch. The unlucky days mentioned on
pages 11 and 32 are curious, and should be compared with the
calendar customs collected in Hampson&rsquo;s <cite>Medii &AElig;vi Kalendarium</cite>.
Of the nature of the customs performed on the various
days it will not be necessary to say much. They are all connected
with divination for a wife or a husband. But they are
curious in preserving the rhyming words of an incantation

<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>

which may be of considerable archaic importance if we could
arrive, by a comparison of all the extant rhymes on this subject,
at something like the original form. Coupled with this are
two significant customs, namely, the journey to the church-door
on St. Agnes Eve (p. 30), which may be considered with
the perambulation of the church recorded on page 18. These
may be compared with the Derbyshire custom recorded in the
<cite>Jour. Arch. Assoc.</cite> vol. vii. p. 209. And the gathering of flowers
in a silent grove on Midsummer Eve (p. 31) should also be noted.</p>

<p>Of customs incidentally mentioned there are divinations connected
with apple (p. 8), cakes (18), cuckoo (20), flowers (19),
hemp-seed (18), lemon (30), new moon (19), nuts (30), peascod
(29). Horn Fair day is mentioned on p. 24. On page 16
in the rhymes there given the game of tick-tack is mentioned.
This is a game at tables similar to backgammon, and is sometimes
called trick-track. Mr. Wheatley, in his <cite>Dictionary of
Reduplicated Words</cite>, has collected the instances of its mention
in the early writers.</p>

<p>The following are the proverbs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2">(1) An ill bird befoules it own nest (6).</p>

<p class="indent2">(2) Kiss and tell is base play (6).</p>

<p class="indent2">(3) If you will not when you may, when you will you shall
have nay (13).</p>

<p class="indent2">(4) Look before you leap (13) (see <cite>Paradise of Daynty
Deuyses</cite>, 1578; Tottel&rsquo;s <cite>Miscellany</cite>, 1557).</p>

<p class="indent2">(5) A slut will poison thy gut (14).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p class="indent2">(6) Riches has wings and flyeth away (14).</p>

<p class="indent2">(7) Ill words corrupt good manners (15).</p>

<p class="indent2">(8) [Old maids] lead apes in hell (18) (see <cite>Much Ado about
Nothing</cite>, act ii. sc. 1.)</p>

<p class="indent2">(9) She that&rsquo;s afraid of the grass must never &mdash;&mdash; in the
meadow (26).</p>

<p class="indent2">(10) One swallow never makes a summer, nor one woodcock
a winter (26) (see Polyd. Virg. <cite>Prov. Libellus</cite>, 1498;
Northbrook&rsquo;s <cite>Treatise against Dauncing</cite> (1577), Swallow&rsquo;s
<cite>Cinthia&rsquo;s Revenge</cite>, 1613; Arist. Ethic. Nicom. lib. i.)</p>

<p class="indent2">(11) Set thy stool in the sun, if a knave goes, an honest
man may come (27).</p>

<p class="indent2">(12) He would have played a lesson on my lute (27).</p>

<p>Only four of these are recorded in Hazlitt, namely, numbers
4, 6, 8, and 10.</p>

</div>

<p>Reading over many ancient histories, it was my chance to
meet with a story of an old woman who lived in the west
county, who took delight in studying how she might know
what a sweetheart she might have, for at that time she thought
she had tarried very long; she being full twenty years of age,
thought (in her mind) that her fortune was not so good as
other maidens, which she knew was married some at fifteen,
and some at sixteen, which troubled her very sore; but to prevent
all other doubts, she was fully resolved to try an old story
which she had heard her Grandmother talk of many a time and
did, and finding some of them to be true she took upon her to
teach other maidens, as you may hear in this following
discourse.</p>

<p>Upon a time this old woman (having newly buried her husband

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>

and was a widow) oftentimes delighted to walk abroad in
the fields, to take the ayr, sometimes thinking of the loss of her
husbands, for she had had three, yet she had a great desire to
have another, intending to try her former rules. So it happened
as she was walking alone, she espied a proper young maid in
the side of a meadow near a hedge side. Good morrow, maid,
said the old woman, how do you do? Are you not well
you look so civily? Yes, said the maid, I am not sick
neither am I very well, for I am a little troubled in my
mind. What is it, said the old woman, tell me, and if I
can do thee any good I shall be very willing, for I have some
little judgment in many things, therefore be not ashamed to tell
me the truth what it is that thou art so much troubled withall.
Indeed, old mother, seeing you urge me so much I shall let you
understand the truth, and thus it is: We be three sisters, and
the youngest was married about a year ago, and the middlemost
last week, and I am the eldest, and no man heeds me. Well,
daughter, if this be all that thou tellest me I do believe I can teach
thee how to ease thyself in this condition, for when I was
young I myself was in the very same condition, and with
reading over some histories I found out the art to know him
that should be my husband, and what colour of hair he should
be, which, if thou will promise me to keep my counsel, I shall
be willing to teach thee. I will truly, and if you will do so
much for me I shall think myself very much beholding unto
you, and if my fortune prove right I will make you amends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Why then I will tell you, in the first place thou must observe
St. Agnes&rsquo;s day, which is upon the 21st day of January, and
on that day thou must be sure to keep a true fast, for thou
must not eat anything all that day nor at night, and be sure
that no man salute thee (not kiss thee I mean), no neither man
woman nor child must kiss thy lips on that day, and then at
night before thou go into thy bed, thou must be sure to put on
a clean shift thou hast, and the best thou hast then the better
thou may speed, and when thou lyest down lay thy right hand
under thy head saying these words, <i>Now the god of love send me
my desires</i>; and make sure thou as soon as thou can and thou
shalt be sure to dream of him which must be thy husband and
see him stand before thee and thou wilt take great notice of him
and his complexion; and if he offer to salute thee do not deny
him but show as much favour unto him as thou can; but if he
offer to be uncivil unto thee make sure to hold thy legs together.
And now, daughter, this counsel which I have given
thee be sure to tell nobody, and so fare you well till I see you
again.</p>

<p>I give you many thanks for your good advice, but one thing
more I have to say unto you, What is your name? and where
do you live? that I may come to see you again for I shall think
the time long. Why I tell thee, daughter, my name is Mother
Bunch and I live at a place called Bonny Venter, and if thou
wilt but take the pains to come thither thou shalt be welcome,
and so farewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Now Mother Bunch being departed from the maid, and
going homeward she meets with another pretty young girl.
Good morrow, Mother Bunch. Good morrow, pretty maid,
whither are you going this morning? methinks you are very
fine to-day. Fine, Mother Bunch, you do but think so. Nay
I cannot discommend you; for such young maids as you must
go handsome, or you will have much ado to get good husbands;
for I know you think the time long. No, no, Mother, I am
too young yet. Why daughter how old are you? Why I am
but eighteen. But eighteen, never but it for I know thou
think&rsquo;st thou hast stayed long enough, and would as fain have a
good husband as another. Aye, but Mother Bunch, good
husbands are ill to find out, and especially with such as I am
which has no skill in chusing, or else it may be I would fain
have a husband as another. Why then daughter take my advice:
if thou would have a good husband thou must be sure to be wise
in chusing, that is to say take not one that hath a red head;
for to be sure he will be one to love the smock so well, that he
will be loth to let his wife have a good one to her back; neither
take one that has yellow hair, for he will be apt to be jealous;
no nor a black man, for they oft prove dogged. Ay, but hark
you Mother Bunch if I must have neither red nor yellow nor
black, what colour must I have then? It may be I have set
my love on a yellow haird man already&mdash;Why, daughter, if it be
so I can [tell] thee what will follow: if he prove jealous of thee
thou wilt be driven into such a condition with his speeches that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>

thou may very well make his words good, for how should
a woman forbear that which she is always told of? for to be
sure if he be jealous of thee, thou hast cause to be jealous of him,
for there is no man or woman that is jealous the one of the
other but they are false themselves, for whores and thieves
think all is alike. But hold a little, daughter, one thing more
I have to say unto thee, and that is this. Take notice of thy
sweethearts, when they come a wooing unto thee (I mean of
their civil behaviour), for if they swear, and bow, and make
great protestations, then have a care of thyself, for many words
breed dissimulation; therefore have a care of such. But if a
man come unto thee that is sparing of his words and very civil
in his carriage, there is hopes he will prove a loving man and
love passeth above all the meanes in the world. Well now
Mother Bunch I must take my leave of you, giving you many
thanks for your good advice; and so farewel, until I see you
again, and I do intend to take your counsel.</p>

<p>Another time Mother Bunch was in a little meadow, not far
from her own house, and it was on the 20th day of April very
early in the morning before sunrising. A handsome young
maid seeing her all alone, came unto her, and said, Mother
Bunch, good morrow, how do you do? pray what makes you
abroad so early this morning? I am persuaded you are in a
study. Daughter you say very true; I am studying who must
be my next husband; and if thou but please to stay a little
while, thou shalt see a pretty art, which thou never saw before,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>

for to teach thee to know thy sweetheart. That is a pretty art
indeed, and I should be very glad to learn that art.</p>

<p>Hark! Hark! daughter, is not yonder the cuckoo singing?
Yes, yes, and I have not heard her sing this year before now.
Then, daughter, sit thee down by me, but hark you daughter,
are you fasting? Yes, I have neither eat nor drank yet. Ay,
but hath no young man kist thee to-day? No I did see no
man to-day. Then sit thee down by me. I think the cuckoo
is mad; what a life she leads; I think she is a witch and knows
what we&rsquo;re doing, but no matter; put off thy right foot shoe
and stocking, and let me look between thy great toes. Now,
daughter, see, this hair (which is a good long one); look well
at it, and what colour it is (I think it is partly yellow). The
very same colour will thy husband&rsquo;s hair be. But, Mother
Bunch I do not matter the colour so much as I do his condition.
I will tell thee his condition; he may prove surly enough, but
thou must strive to please him as much as you can both night
and day for he will be very apt to go astray, and if he do thou
must not much heed him but give him good words for thou
hast very bad luck if thou cannot do him one good turn for
another; but as for that thou must keep that to thyself; an ill
bird befoules its own nest; kiss and tell is base play. Mother
Bunch you make me smile, you talk so merrily. Come,
daughter, &rsquo;tis no great matter; merry talk does do no harm, but
drives the time away; but as for the deed doing, I leave that
to your own discretion. But hark you! daughter, I have had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>

three husbands myself, and I think to have another yet, and do
you think I am so mad to tell him all that I do? no I am not
so mad and I think thou wilt be a little wiser and yet daughter,
I have another way for to teach thee how thou shalt come to
know who must be thy husband, and I have approved it true;
for I tryed it myself, and now is the best time of the year to
try it, therefore take notice of what I say: Take a St. Thomas
onion, and peel it, and lay it in a clean handkerchief and lay it
under your head; and put on a clean smock, and be sure the
room be clean swept where you lye, and as soon as you be laid
down, be sure lay thy arms abroad, and say these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Good St. Thomas do me right,</div>
    <div class="verse">And bring my love to me this night,</div>
    <div class="verse">That I may look him in the face,</div>
    <div class="verse">And in my arms may him embrace.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Then lying on thy back, with thy arms abroad, fall asleep as
soon as thou can, and in thy first sleep thou shalt dream of him
which shall be thy husband, and he will come and offer to kiss
thee, but do not hinder him, but strive to catch him in thy arms,
and if thou do get hold of him that is he which must be thy
husband but if thou get not hold of him thou must try another
night, and if thou do get hold of him hold him fast, for that
is he. This I have try&rsquo;d, and it has prov&rsquo;d true. Yet I have
another pretty way for a maid to know her sweetheart, which
is as followeth: Take a summer apple, of the best fruit you can
get, and take three of the best pins you can get, and stick them

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>

into the apple close to the head, and as you stick them in take
notice which of them is in the middle, and what name thou
fancies best give that middle pin and put it into thy left handed
glove, and lay it under thy pillow on a Saturday at night, but
thou must be in bed before thou lays it under thy head, and
when thou hast done, clasp thy hands together, speaking these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">If thou be he that must have me</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">To be thy wedded bride,</div>
    <div class="verse">Make no delay, but come away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">This night to my bedside.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And in thy first sleep thou shalt see him come in his shirt
and lie down by thee, and if he offer thee any abuse it will be a
great sign he will prove one that will love other women as well
as thee; but if he do put his hand over thee to imbrace thee be
not afraid of him, for it is a great sign he will prove a good
husband; and this is a good way for a young man to know his
sweetheart, giving the middlemost pin the name he fancies best,
putting an apple in his right handed glove, and lay it under his
pillow, when he is in bed, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">If thou be she that must have me</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">In wedlock for to join,</div>
    <div class="verse">Make no delay but come away</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Unto this bed of mine.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And that night he shall see her come, and if she come in her
smock and petticoat, which is a great sign she will prove a very
civil woman; but if she come without her petticoat there is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>

danger she will prove a ranter, and therefore better lost than
won. And now, daughter, the time passeth away and I must
be gone, and so I bid you farewel. Mother Bunch, I give you
many thanks for your good counsel, and intend to take your
advice, and so fare you well.</p>

Bonny Venter in the West.</i></span></h3>
</div>

<p>Upon a time Mother Bunch, being bidden to a wedding,
where a great many young men and maids were met together,
they knowing she was a very old woman had a great desire to
drink with her and to have some civil discourse, she coming to
them said one young man unto her, Mother Bunch, we know
that you are a woman that hath judgment in many things;
pray will you tell me my fortune? Why dost thou think that
I can tell fortunes, no I can tell no fortunes, but I can tell thee
that thou wilt never be true to one woman thou blinks so
much on one eye, therefore hold down thy tongue. Ay, but
Mother Bunch, saith another, what think you of me. Of thee,
why I tell thee thou may come to marry a lady, if thou can but
lay a great wager with her, three to one; and if she do but lay
with thee, thou wilt be very likely to win, for thou hast mettle
in thee; but have a care she win not the odds of thee, for if she
do then thou art clean gone; so farewel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Now old Mother Bunch takes her leave; and going homeward
she meets with a young maid which was going to the
wedding. How do you do, mother? Thank you, daughter.
Whither art a going? To the wedding I believe; ay, Mother
Bunch, so I am; but hark you, mother, will you sit down a
little, I have something to say to you. What is it daughter?
Why mother you can tell many things if you please, and I
would have you when you think I shall be married, ay but
daughter would you fain be married? Yes, mother, if I could
but get a good husband. Then, daughter, I will tell thee the
best I can, if thou will take my advice. In the month of
January there are many very dangerous days for thee to take
notice of in many kind of waies, and I will give thee notice of
them, that is the first, the second, the fourth and fifth; there is
a great many more, but in these there is great danger, for if thou
think to be married on any of these daies I say there will be
great danger that thy husband will make thee a cuckold, or thou
wilt make him one, or else you will be soon parted by one means
or other; but for all that there be so many bad daies in this
month, yet I can tell of one day in this month which is lucky,
and many young men and maids have a deal of hearts ease on
that day, or the day after, as I shall let thee understand if thou
wilt but take my advice I shall tell thee there is in January a
day called St. Agnes day, it is alwaies the one and twentieth
day of the month. This St. Agnes has a great favour to young
men and maids, and will bring to their bedsides (as that night)

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>

their sweethearts, if they will follow this rule as I shall declare
unto thee; therefore take good notice of what I shall tell thee:
Upon this St. Agnes day you must be sure to keep a true fast,
for thou must neither eat nor drink all that day, nor at night,
neither let any man, woman or child kiss thee that day; and
thou must be sure at night when thou goest to bed, to put on
a clean shift, and the best thou hast the better thou maist speed,
and thou must have clean cloaths on thy head, for St. Agnes does
love to see clean clothes when she comes; and when thou liest
down on thy bed, lie thee down on thy back as straight as thou
canst, and lay both thy hands under thy head behind and say
these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Now good St. Agnes play thy part,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And send to me my own sweetheart;</div>
    <div class="verse">And shew me such an happy bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">This night of him to have a kiss.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And then be sure to fall asleep as soon as thou canst and
before thou awake out of thy first sleep, thou shalt see him come
and stand before thee, and thou shalt perceive by his habit what
tradesman he is; but be sure thou declare not thy dream unto
any body in ten daies and by that time thou may come to see
thy dream come to pass. All this I have approved three times;
for I have had three husbands, and they proved all three tradesmen;
the first was a straw joiner, the second was a louse trap
maker, and the third was of the gentle craft; and he come to
me with his awl in his hand, and would needs prick me, ay and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>

did prick me, but it did not hurt me; for when I awaked out
of my dream I was never the worse; but I thought the time
very long till he came again, and so will all maidens do that
have a desire to be married, but as for all those maids which is
not minded to try St. Agnes I will tell thee the best way I can
to choose them husbands by phansie, for I know some maids
would have husbands some of one condition and some of another,
for some will say that they will have a handsome man and a
neat man, a witty man and a pretty man, nay there is no good
conditions that belong to a man but they would have him to
have them all, which is a thing impossible, but I must needs
tell such as be so covetous that may come to be beholden to the
old proverb which says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">If you will not when you may,</div>
    <div class="verse">When you will you shall have nay.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Therefore take my advice, and that is, if a young man comes
unto you which is of a civil carriage, and of a good honest
parentage, and thou think that thou canst love him, then thou
must not be scornful with him, but give him civil entertainment,
according to his behaviour; but of all conditions be sure to hold
thy legs together, till thou have authority to lay them wide
open.</p>

<p>And as for young men, my advice is to them to be wary in
their choice, for there is as much danger in chusing a wife as
can be in young women chusing husbands, for there is deceit
in both; therefore, I advise all young men to <em>look before they</em>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>

<em>leap</em>, and in so doing they may prevent danger in time, therefore
young men take a little of my advice in your choice; if
thou can chuse take not one that hath a long nose with a
scowling brow, and thin lips, for in such is great danger, for
such commodity proves to have a long tongue, and that often
proves the worst weapon a woman has, for I am sure he that is
ty&rsquo;d to a scold, is ty&rsquo;d to a world of sorrow; also chuse not
one that is counted a slut, for if she be a slut to be sure she is
idle withall, and those two conditions will bring thee to poverty;
nay besides, the old saying is, <cite>A slut will poison thy gut</cite>, and if
thou disdain to eat with her, thou wilt think much to lie with
her, if thou forsake her bed thou must have one somewhere,
but where judge thou thyself. Yet now I will let you understand
my best advice for young men to chuse them wives: in
the first place be sure thou take one for love, not altogether for
riches, for riches has wings and flyeth away; but true love
will never decay; for where love is there is the blessing of God,
and where the blessing of God is there can be no want, but
if thy desire be to have a wife to live a loving contented life
withall, then thou must not set thy mind too much on riches,
but chuse a good handsome civil maid, which is not given to
pride, nor scornful in carriage and of uncivil parentage; such
a maid may make a good wife; but one that has a great portion
will look to be maintained proudly, nay besides she instead of
rubbing thy shins in bed will be sure to rub thy nose oft with
her great portion, which will breed a great deal of dissension,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>

for ill words corrupt good manners, and one evil word brings in
another, so let this suffice you have a desire to have good
wives: and take notice of what I have already said, and you
may come to speed the better.</p>

<p>And as for young maids, this is my advice, if they will not
try St. Agnes fortune then let them be sure to chuse a handsome
young man that is lusty and able to do his work; for if
she be fain to seek for another to do that work which he should
do it may breed great dissension.</p>

<p>And thus endeth Mother Bunch&rsquo;s advice to all young men
and maids, wishing good luck and good fortune to them all.

<p>Now for those poor young creatures that have pined themselves
to the green sickness, and neglected the cure till it is
almost past, those that are the worst pretenders to phisnomy
might easily guess their distemper and prescribe their remedy
without the help of a dispensatory, and all those of what constitution
soever, that languish in single sheets till fifteen; I will
tell (if your courage will serve to try the experiment) how you
shall know and see the persons that shall ease you of the simple
thing so much talked of called a maidenhead, by him that must
be your husband, collected from the Twelve Sybils, Trismajistus,
and Cornelius Agrippa, and this is</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center"><i>The First Way.</i></p>

<p>You that desire to know it this way must wait till Midsummer
Eve, then at night three or four of you, or more or less, must
take your smocks and dip them in fair water, then turn the
wrong side outwards, and hang them on chairs before the fire,
and have by you a vessel with drink in it and lay some salt in
another before the fire, and be sure not to speak a word whatever
you hear or see. In a little time the likeness of those
persons you shall marry will come and turn your smocks, and
drink to you; now if there be any of you that will never marry,
they will hear a bell, but not the rest but whoever hears this
bell none of my authors is positive that she shall dye a maid.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center"><i>Another, and quickly tried.</i></p>

<p>Which is this: you are only to take a little hemp-seed and go

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>

into what place you please by yourself, and carry the seed in
your apron, and with your right hand throw it over your left
shoulder, saying thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Hemp-seed I sow, hemp-seed I sow,</div>
    <div class="verse">And he that must be my true love,</div>
    <div class="verse">Come after me and mow.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And at the ninth time expect to see the figure of him you are
to wed, or else hear a bell, as before.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Yet though you hear the sad and dismal bell,</div>
    <div class="verse">&rsquo;Tis your fault if you lead apes in hell.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center"><i>Another way.</i></p>

<p>Which is this: you that dare venture yourselves into a church-yard
just as it strikes twelve, take there a naked sword in your
hand, and go nine times about the church, saying only thus, <em>Here&rsquo;s
the sword, but where&rsquo;s the scabbard?</em> Which continue all the
time you go round; and the ninth time the person you are to
marry will meet you with a scabbard, and so kiss you; if not, a
bell as before.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center"><i>Another, which is called the Dutch Cake.</i></p>

<p>Three, or four, or more of you are to make a cake of half
flour and half salt (no matter what flour it is) and some of every
one of your own water, make this cake broad and thin, then
every one of you either make a mark that you know or set
the two first letters of your name on it with a pin or bodkin,
but leave such a distance that it may be cut; then set it before

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>

the fire to bake, but all this while speak not a word. Turn it
every one of you once, then let it bake a little more and then
throw on every one a little salt and she that turn&rsquo;d it first let
her turn it again, then the person to be her husband will cut
out her name and break it in two and give her one half, and so the
next, and the next, till the last. If there be any so unfortunate
to hear a bell, I wish I had them to my bedfellows this night to
prevent leading apes in hell.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center"><i>Another way.</i></p>

<p>The first change of the new moon in the new year; the first
time you see, hold your hands across, saying this three times,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">New moon, new moon, I pray thee</div>
    <div class="verse">Tell me this night who my true love will be.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Then go to bed without speaking any more that night and you
will certainly dream of the person you are to marry.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center"><i>Another, experienced very often.</i></p>

<p>Young men or maids may do onely this: Take some rosemarry
flowers, and some bay leaves, a little thyme, sweet marjoram,
and sidder wood; make these into powder, and with a
little barley flour make a cake, but do not bake it. Lay this

<hr class="r10" />

<p>One Michaelmas-day old Mother Bunch sitting upon the
bank of a river, joining to a neighbouring grove, she beheld
the late flourishing branches in their decay, whose leaves were
falling to the earth. From this she began to consider seriously
of her own mortality; and since Old Time had hurried on the
Winter of her age, which had covered her head with grey locks,
she might expect e&rsquo;er long she must fall like the leaves to the
earth; therefore she resolved, in regard she had always been a
kind friend to young men and maids, that she would leave a
fair testimony of her love before she left the world; since her
painful study and strict observation had made a large improvement
in her stock of knowledge, she would not have it buried
in the grave with her, but leave it to posterity, for the benefit
of young men and maids, whereby they may learn to understand
their good and bad fortunes, and by the direction of this book,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>

be furnished with many secret rarities never published to the
world.</p>

<p>Accordingly the next day she wrote letters of invitation to
the young men and maids to repair to her house on St. Luke&rsquo;s
day; the maids she appointed to come in the morning to be first
instructed, for these two reasons as she herself was a woman,
she would teach the young women first, lest the batchelors
should be too severe on them; the second was it being Horn
Fair day, many of the batchelors would be employed in the
morning, in handing old citizens young wives to the fair, and
in the afternoon they might be at liberty. This was the determination
of Old Mother Bunch.</p>

MOTHER BUNCH, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Now against the day appointed, Mother Bunch deck&rsquo;d her
house, and getting up very early that morning she placed herself
in the closet where her treasure lay. Now the first that entered
the room was Margery Loveman, a maltster&rsquo;s maid, who with a
low curtsey said, Good morrow, Mother Bunch, I am come to
partake of your bounty; for I hear you have a second time
opened your Golden Closet of Curiosities.&mdash;Yes, daughter, said
she, so I have, and thou shalt partake of it.&mdash;Here are infallible
rules and directions in all manner of love intrigues, that you may
know what sort of man you&rsquo;ll marry, and whether he will prove
loving or no. Dear mother these are the things I would know;
for believe me out of all my sweethearts I&rsquo;d willingly chuse the
best; &rsquo;tis true I have 150<i>l.</i> the noise of which has brought many

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>

sweethearts, and I&rsquo;d willingly know which come for pure love
and which for the lucre of the money. Daughter, said she,
here is an experiment, if you will but try it, will make a full
discovery of the reality of their love. Let a report be spread,
that you are robbed of all you have in the world; if, after this,
there is any one continues his love as before, you may be sure
he is faithful. But be sure keep this counsel to yourself, that
the mystery may not be discovered. I&rsquo;ll take care of that, dear
mother, quoth Margery, and I heartily thank you for this kind
advice, so good morrow, for I must needs go.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Good morrow, daughter, she reply&rsquo;d,</div>
    <div class="verse">Young men are false and must be try&rsquo;d.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>She was no sooner gone, but in came Mrs. Susan, a young
Sempstress from Salisbury, who entered wringing of her hands.
How now, quoth she, what&rsquo;s the matter daughter, you take
on at this rate? Alas! Mother Bunch, quoth Susan, my, my,
my&mdash;&mdash;. What&rsquo;s the matter? Why my sorrow is more than
I am able to bear; for mother, dear Frank, the fiddler and I are
fallen out and he swears he will not have me. Come, daughter,
quoth she, be of good cheer, I&rsquo;ll put you in a way to see
whether he is angry or no. She that&rsquo;s afraid of the grass must
never piss in a meadow. One swallow never makes a summer,
nor one woodcock a winter. Let your angry lover alone for a
season, and he&rsquo;ll come to himself again; for I know fond love
is a puny darling, and wants humouring; therefore let him
alone, in time he&rsquo;ll forget his anger, and return to thee again, if

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>

he has any principle of good nature or loyal love in him, and if
not, you had better be without him, than for your lifetime to
be ty&rsquo;d to a sour apple-tree. Remember the old proverb, Set
thy stool in the sun, if a knave goes an honest man may come.
I hope you have not play&rsquo;d the wanton with him. No,
mother, but he fain would have play&rsquo;d a lesson on my lute the
other market day only, but I had more grace than to let him.
Say&rsquo;st thou so, daughter? Why I tell thee, he did it to try
thee, and since he finds that you withstood him, he will never
leave you. Well, dear mother, she said, your words are comfortable
to me, and when I find the good effects, I&rsquo;ll return and
give you an account; and now mother, farewel.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Right happy daughter may you be,</div>
    <div class="verse">In guarding your virginity.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The next which entered the room was Margaret, the
miller&rsquo;s maid, who after making a low curtsey and giving
Mother Bunch the time of the day, desired to know for what
reason she sent her a letter. Why quoth the old woman, to
the end that I might reveal to you some secrets, that are both
relative and conducive to love, which I have never yet discovered
to the world. But mother, said Margaret, I am a meer
stranger to love, for I never knew what it meant. That may
be, quoth she, yet you know not how soon you may receive the
arrows of Cupid, and then you&rsquo;ll be glad of some of my advice;
for I know the best of you desires to lie with a man; and I&rsquo;ll
appeal to you if you would not be glad of a husband. Mother,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>

quoth Margaret, you come too close to the matter, and if I
may speak my mind, I&rsquo;d willingly embrace such a one; for
although housekeeping is chargeable, yet marriage is honourable.
Thou say&rsquo;st well daughter, quoth Mother Bunch, and if
thou hast a mind to see the man, follow my directions and you
shall not fail. Let me see, this is St. Luke&rsquo;s Day, which I
have found by my long experience to be fitter for this purpose
than St. Agnes&rsquo;s and the ingredients more excellent. Take
Marygold flowers, a sprig of Marjoram, Thyme, and a little
Wormwood; dry them before a fire, rub them to powder, then
sift it thro&rsquo; a fine piece of lawn; simmer these, with a small
quantity of virgin honey, in white wine vinegar, over a slow
fire; with this anoint your stomach, breast and lips, when lying
down and repeat these words thrice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">St. Luke, St. Luke, be kind to me,</div>
    <div class="verse">In dreams let me my true love see.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This said, hasten to sleep, and in the soft slumbers of your
nights repose, the very man whom you shall marry will appear
before you, walking to and fro, near your bedside, very plain
and visible to be seen. You shall perfectly behold his visage,
stature and deportment and if he be one that will prove a
loving husband, he will approach you with a smile; which if
he does, do not seem to be overfond or peevish, but receive the
same with a mild and modest blush. But if he be one, who
after marriage will forsake thy bed to wander off after strange
women, he will offer to be rude and uncivil with thee. These

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>

are rarities I have never before divulged, and will prove of
advantage. I must thank you for all your love, quoth Margaret,
and so farewel, good Mother Bunch. Good-bye, dear daughter,
she immediately reply&rsquo;d,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Let Joy and Pleasure crown your Days,</div>
    <div class="verse">And a kind Man your Fortune Raise.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Next came in Kate the clothworker&rsquo;s daughter, Doll the
dairymaid, Joan, Bridget, Nancy, Phillis, etc. in all about forty
together, who almost filled the room, each of them crying, Dear
Mother Bunch, remember me, O mother, remember me, etc.
that they made the old woman deaf with their great noise.
My dear daughters, quoth the old woman, set you down and
be quiet, and you shall partake of my benediction. Now
daughters, I&rsquo;ll sit in the midst of you and read you a lecture;
meaning to give you an account of some extraordinary curiosities
here in my closet newly broke open; declaring that the things
which are profitable for one maid are so for another.</p>

<p>First, if any one here desires to know the name of the man
whom they shall marry, let her who desires this seek for a green
peascod, in which there are full nine peas; which done either
write or cause to be written on a small slip of paper these
words:</p>

<p class="center small">Come in my dear and do not fear.</p>

<p>Which writing you must enclose within the aforesaid peascod,
and lay it under the door. Then mind the next person who
comes in, for you&rsquo;ll certainly marry one of the same name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, she who desires to be satisfied whether she shall
enjoy the man desired or no; Let her take two lemon peels in
the morning, and wear them all day under her armpits; then
at night let her rub the four posts of the bed with them; which
done in your sleep he will seem to come and present you with
a couple of lemons, but if not, there is no hope.</p>

<p>Thirdly, she who desires to know to what manner of fortune
she shall be married, if a gentleman, a tradesman, or a traveller.
The experiment is this, take a walnut, a hazlenut, and a
nutmeg, grate them and mix them up with butter and sugar
into pills, which must be taken at lying down, and then if her
fortune be to marry a gentleman, her sleep will be filled with
golden dreams, if a tradesman, odd noises and tumults, if a
traveller, then will thunder and lightning disturb her.</p>

<p>Fourthly, St. Agnes&rsquo;s day I have not yet blotted out of my
book; but I have found a more exact way of trial than before.
You need not abstain from kisses, nor be forced to keep fast
for the glance of a lover in the night. If you can but rise to
be at the church-door between the hours of twelve and one in
the morning; and then put the forefinger of your right hand
into the keyhole, and then repeat the following words thrice,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">O sweet St. Agnes now draw near,</div>
    <div class="verse">And with my true love strait appear.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Then will he presently approach with a smiling countenance.</p>

<p>Fifthly, my daughters, know ye the 14th of February is
Valentine&rsquo;s day, at which time the fowls of the air begin to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>

couple; and the young men and maids are for chusing their
mates. Now that you may speed, take this approved direction:
Take five Bay leaves, lay one under every corner of your pillow,
and the fifth in the middle; then lying down to rest, repeat
these lines seven times over:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Sweet Guardian Angel let me have</div>
    <div class="verse">What I most earnestly do crave</div>
    <div class="verse">A Valentine endow&rsquo;d with love,</div>
    <div class="verse">That will both kind and constant prove.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Then to your content you&rsquo;ll either have the Valentine you
desire, or one more excellent.</p>

<p>Sixthly, the old experiment of the Midsummer smock found
out in a much better method than before, by my sublime and
painful study in philosophy. And now, my daughters, said she,
it is thus: Let seven of you go together on Midsummer Eve,
just at sunset, into a silent grove, and gather every one of you
a sprig of red sage, and return into a private room, with a stool
in the middle; each one having a clean smock, turned wrong
side outwards, hanging on a line cross the room, and let every
one lay their sprig of red sage in a clean bason of rose water,
set on the stool; which done place yourselves on a row, and
continue till twelve or one, saying nothing, be it what you will
you see; for after midnight each one&rsquo;s sweetheart or husband
that shall be, will take each maids sprig out of the rose water,
and sprinkle his love&rsquo;s shift; and those who are so unfortunate,
as never to be married, their sprigs will not be moved, but in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>

lieu of that, sobs and sighs will be heard. This has been often
try&rsquo;d and it never failed of its effects.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">These things I have found out of late,</div>
    <div class="verse">To make young lovers fortunate.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And now, my dear daughters, I have but a word or two more
to say at the present, and that by way of caution.</p>

<p>In the twelvemonths I find about thirty-one days unlucky;
so as you tender your own happiness, take care you marry not
on those days, and for your better instruction I will set down
those days for you.</p>

<p class="indent2">In January are four, the 7th, 14th, 17th, and 18th.</p>

<p class="indent2">In February two, the 5th and 10th.</p>

 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Observe my Rules of all these days,</div>
    <div class="verse">And then you will your Fortunes raise.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This said, old Mother Bunch gave them a cup of her cordial
water, and so dismiss&rsquo;d them, the young Damsels returning her
hearty thanks for her motherly advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>After Mother Bunch had dined, the young men came, as
Tom the Miller, Ralph the Thatcher, and Robin the Ploughman,
with a great many of other trades and callings, whom
Mother Bunch invited to sit down, that so she might the better
deliver her salutary counsel to them.</p>

<p>And first, she begins with Tom the Miller, saying, Ah, Tom,
thou art a sad fellow, there&rsquo;s not a maid comes to the mill but
you will be bobbing under their aprons; but take my word for
it, if you don&rsquo;t leave off, you&rsquo;ll be ruined. What woman will
have such a one? She may justly conclude, you will be caterwauling
still. You know what I mean Tom. Yes, yes, mother,
but sure you don&rsquo;t take me for such a one. Yes Tom, I do,
and I am but seldom mistaken; &rsquo;tis you millers that fill the
country with crack&rsquo;d maidenheads, that the honest husbandman
already finds the ground till&rsquo;d up. But farewell, I will have
nothing to do with such as you.</p>

<p>Then turning to Ralph the Thatcher, she said, I find you are
desirous of a wife, and your ambition is such, she must be rich,
young and beautiful. So you can&rsquo;t be content with honest
Joan, to whom you promis&rsquo;d marriage, but must change her for
a finikin madam; but I can tell you she won&rsquo;t stand picking
of straws with you; her fair face will find her many friends in
a corner; and so you may chance to be a cuckold, and indeed
but justly served in your kind; and therefore I pray you to return
to your old lover, for she is an honest girl, and therefore far more
fit for you than such a butterfly as you have lately followed.</p>

<p>Then she stretched forth her hand to Robin the Plowman,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

saying, Thou art an honest fellow, and good luck will attend
thee; I don&rsquo;t mean bags of gold nor heaps of silver, but thou shalt
have an industrious wife, one who will be willing to labour, a true
and faithful yokemate, who will be a chearful partner in thy weal
or woe, to support thee under thy troubles, as the Poet has it,</p>
